# Surplus after expenses: city Rs12,000/mo, outer Rs18,000/mo on a Rs1,00,000 salary.
# REBALANCE (2026-07-21): was city 40,000 / outer 25,000 total, leaving a Rs60-75k
# risk-free surplus every single month. With nothing able to lose money at that scale,
# every player finished rich and the leaderboard bunched at the top. Expenses now
# consume ~7/8 of income, so allocation decisions actually bind.
#
# SECOND PASS: an earlier attempt at 78k/72k (Rs22-28k surplus) still failed the
# balance sim — accumulated salary dominated every investment decision, the spread
# between the best and worst strategy was only 1.16x, and simply HOARDING CASH beat
# investing. A game that rewards passivity teaches the opposite of what this event
# is for. Surplus is now small enough that returns on capital, not payroll, decide
# the leaderboard.

# guaranteed win and made every other decision in the game irrelevant.
